<p>墨水屏更新非常慢，且某些墨水屏通过IO的形式传输数据，无法通过mapped memory的形式</p>
<p>直接对接到FB。</p>
<p>问题可以总结为：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to memory map a “non memory mappable” IO interface like GPIO.</li>
<li>How to mitigate the latency associated with display updates.</li>
<li>How to cheaply detect when userspace has written to a memory mapped address.</li>
</ol>

<p>解决方法：</p>
<p><strong>Deferred IO</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deferred IO is an alternative method of solving these problems. The key concept behind deferred IO is that one can periodically mark an active page of host memory as read-only in order to catch writes to it. The way it works is quite straightforward: page table entries for framebuffer pages in host memory are initially marked as read-only. When the application first writes to any memory address that maps to any of those pages, a deferred IO specific page fault handler is reached. This handler schedules a delayed workqueue job. In the interval before this workqueue is executed, the application can continue to write to that page with no additional cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Deferred IO is a way to delay and repurpose IO. It uses host memory as a
buffer and the MMU pagefault as a pretrigger for when to perform the device
IO. The following example may be a useful explanation of how one such setup
works:

- userspace app like Xfbdev mmaps framebuffer
- deferred IO and driver sets up fault and page_mkwrite handlers
- userspace app tries to write to mmaped vaddress
- we get pagefault and reach fault handler
- fault handler finds and returns physical page
- we get page_mkwrite where we add this page to a list
- schedule a workqueue task to be run after a delay
- app continues writing to that page with no additional cost. this is
  the key benefit.
- the workqueue task comes in and mkcleans the pages on the list, then
 completes the work associated with updating the framebuffer. this is
  the real work talking to the device.
- app tries to write to the address (that has now been mkcleaned)
- get pagefault and the above sequence occurs again</code></pre>
